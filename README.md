# Project #2: Building Your First Full-stack Application
As part of GA Software Engineering Immersive course, I have made a workout app :muscle: for my second project. The criteria was to make a password-protected, full-stack CRUD application that stores data in PostgreSQL.

Users can log their workouts including exercises and sets/reps and share it with other users.

## Technologies used
Javascript, Node.js Postgres, Express, EJS, CSS

# Inspiration
I was talking to my lifting coach about how she couldn't find a great app that logged workouts. The one we were currently using was full of many bugs so I thought I would dabble in making my own.

# :thinking: Planning
It didn't take long in the planning process for me to realise the capacity of what I wanted to make in a bit over 3 days...

## Schema Tables
During class codealongs we had only worked with ideas that required 2 tables â€“ one representing someone using your application (users), and one that stored whatever was the intended purpose of the app. As I began to draw out my ERD, I started adding more and more tables to the mix.
